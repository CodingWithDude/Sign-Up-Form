# Sign-Up-Form

Test sign up form for The Odin Project

Current State:
Basic layout and css is done
Scope of project does not include submitting data
Site is NOT responsive currently

Future Goals:
Make site responsive
Add in js to validate password is valid
Update css for highlighting skipped required input

What I learned:
Played around alot more with grid and flexbox, still have
much more to learn on this
Practiced using root variables more
Transitioned off px for font values to rem
How to manipulate psudeo elements more for :link :hover :visited

Areas I need to improve skills on:
General layout structure with grid and flex
How to make the font and input fields scale (need to start using media queries I think)
Sooo much more to learn with css, feels harder than js ROFL
